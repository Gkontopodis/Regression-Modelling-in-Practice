# Test a Basic Linear Regression Model

## Preview
The data was provided by the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), which was conducted in a random sample of 43,093 U.S. adults and designed to determine the magnitude of alcohol use and psychiatric disorders. The data analytic subset, examined in this study, includes individuals aged between 18 and 30 years old who reported using cannabis at least once in their life (N=2,412). This assignment aims to evaluate the association between major depression diagnosis in the last 12 months (categorical explanatory variable) and cannabis dependence symptoms (quantitative response variable) during the same period, using a linear regression model.
